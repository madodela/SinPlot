SinPlot
==========

SinPlot is a Java program that plots a sinusoidal function. The program draws Cartesian coorinates & the function f(x) = sin(x) + 2.0 * cos(x). Just for fun there is a bit of code to randomly color each line segment & project lines from the origin for a faux 3D effect.

1. Compile with:
	javac SinPlot.java
2. Run with:
	java SinPlot
